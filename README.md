# CMPLR-P0
Project 0 for Program Translation Project CS 4280 @ UMSL

How to Run:

make :
        Creates the binaries and compiles the source files, main will not be put into a bin directory
        
./main :
        This will run the program defaulted to keyboard input instead of reading from a text file
        
./main *filename*.sp2021 :
        A readable file must have the extension .sp2021 in order to be read properly
        
 
 KNOWN ISSUE
 
 DO NOT run the program by reading the file as ./main < *filename*.sp2021 if you are wanting custom named output files. This method will produce output.in-/pre-/post-order files.
